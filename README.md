Middle-Endian Bit-Ordered Palindromic Number Search

Calculate the Middle-Endianness of an integer, and aid in the search of Middle-Endian Bit-Ordered Palindromic numbers.
Middle-Endian Bit-Ordered Palindromic Numbers are numbers whose Middle-Endian Bit Order is equivalent to their value.
There are 93 Middle-Endian Bit-Ordered Palindromes less than 1,000,000, and we are still attempting to understand
the pattern underlying their formation.

There is an infinite amount of these numbers (see 2^n - 1), but it is not known whether every one of these numbers follows 
a certain pattern, or if they are random.
