Middle-Endian Bit-Ordered Palindromic Number Search

This python converts an integer into its Middle-Endian Bit-Ordered form. Calculate the Middle-Endianness of an integer, 
and aid in the search of Middle-Endian Bit-Ordered Palindromic numbers.
Middle-Endian Bit-Ordered Palindromic Numbers are numbers whose Middle-Endian Bit Order is equivalent to their value.
There are 93 Middle-Endian Bit-Ordered Palindromes less than 1,000,000, and I am still trying to understand the
underlying structure of these numbers.
